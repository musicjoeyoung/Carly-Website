              At the age of six, Carly penned her first poem titled, “The
              Cookie Crumbled,” expressing her grief over her parents’
              separation. Although her writing has evolved throughout the
              years, she continues to explore love, loss, and grief, examine
              the fragility of connection, and grapple with the complexities
              of the human experience. Her works have appeared in several
              literary journals, including <em>Brevity </em>and{" "}
              <em>100 Word Story.</em>

              She lives with her composer-performer husband, Joe, and their
              adorable rescue cat, Hudson.
